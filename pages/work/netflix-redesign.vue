      After being frustrated with Netflix's poor UI on mobile, I decided to make a project out of it.
      Funnily enough, after I completed this homescreen redesign, the actual netflix app recieved a
      small visual update, which I do suppose is a step in the right direction.

      I've recently started falling in love with apple's
      ui style patterns, and there is a definitely a note of inspiration in the way items are diplayed.
      Though, I didn't use the stereotipically easy to use San Francisco font (rest in peace Helvetica),
      and decided to go with Inter, a great all-rounder font (which is also plastered all over this site).
      This redesign was really built in mind with the larger size of the iPhone X and it's nearly
      non-existant bezels.
