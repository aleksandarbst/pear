      When our team recieved an assignment to create a mockup business, I was immediately
      chosen for the role of building and creating the visual aspects and branding for said
      business. This was exciting, because I had been given a chance to design something
      that can applied to the real world, and was based around a real idea that we had.
      The initial concept was that of a company focused on safe fitness supplements and
      additants. With this in mind, we settled on the name 'ARMOR'.

      The colour pallete was aimed at provoking a strong, established figure, and the cyrilic
      message (which stands as a company motto) roughly translates to 'lots of strenght in a
      small package'. With the (dark blue) as a sleek background colour, the provocatively
      bright (red) stands much clearer and more defined, contrasting the nearly-white lettering.
